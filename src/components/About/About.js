    <p>
      I am a full-stack JavaScript developer, currently specialising in
      frontend, client side solutions. My preferred stack is MERN, though I am
      very much open to learning and working with all sorts of web related
      technologies. I like keeping up with the latest news and developments and
      putting them to good use in my work. What I place even more importance on,
      however, is writing clean, readable and well documented code. I am
      constantly looking for ways to learn & improve. To this end, I always
      welcome constructive criticism and feedback from my peers. I enjoy
      collaborative work and presenting a well-articulated argument when making
      either architectural or implementation detail level decisions.
