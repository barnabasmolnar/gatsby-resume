My main responsibilites are developing **client side web interfaces**, working in close connection with the backend and UX/UI teams. Our current frontend stack is largely based on React which I very much enjoy working with. I place considerable emphasis on writing robust solutions with regard to application-level state management and business logic. I also frequently collaborate with our backend team, often working on our node.js based gateway solutions as well as doing regular code reviews. In line with the company's values and culture, I find it imperative to write high quality and well documented code.
